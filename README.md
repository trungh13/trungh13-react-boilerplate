# trungh13-react-boilerplate
I made the boilerplate for making my own ReactJS application. The boilerplate will update by times when Application-base need to be more mature by times.

trungh13-react-boilerplate was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
git clone https://github.com/trungh13/trungh13-react-boilerplate.git

cd trungh13-react-boilerplate

npm install
```
### Using
First of all, you need to change the package.json.
From :
```
  "name": "trungh13-react-boilerplate",
```
To:
```
  "name": "your-project-name",
```
##
